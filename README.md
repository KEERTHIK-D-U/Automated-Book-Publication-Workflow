## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Google Gemini API key
- Git

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
```bash
git clone <your-repository-url>
cd automated-book-publication
```

2. **Create virtual environment**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Install Playwright browsers**
```bash
playwright install
```

5. **Configure API key**
```bash
# Set your Gemini API key in the demo_workflow() function
GEMINI_API_KEY = "your-api-key-here"
```

## Usage

### Basic Usage
```bash
python ai.py
```

### API Usage Example
```python
from ai import BookPublicationWorkflow, WorkflowAPI

# Initialize workflow
workflow = BookPublicationWorkflow("your-api-key")
api = WorkflowAPI(workflow)

# Process a chapter
result = await api.start_chapter_processing(
    url="https://example.com/chapter1",
    title="Chapter 1",
    style_instructions="Make prose more engaging"
)
```

## Workflow Stages

### 1. Content Acquisition
- **Web Scraping**: Extract content from specified URLs
- **Screenshot Capture**: Visual documentation of source
- **Initial Storage**: Save original content with metadata

### 2. AI Processing
- **Content Spinning**: AI-powered content enhancement
- **Quality Review**: Automated content review and improvement
- **Version Creation**: Track each processing stage

### 3. Human Review
- **Review Request**: Flag content for human review
- **Feedback Collection**: Capture human feedback and revisions
- **Approval Process**: Human approval workflow

### 4. Finalization
- **Content Finalization**: Mark content as publication-ready
- **Search Indexing**: Add to searchable content database
- **Publication**: Ready for distribution

## Content Status Tracking

The system tracks content through these stages:
- `SCRAPED`: Original content extracted
- `AI_WRITTEN`: Content enhanced by AI
- `AI_REVIEWED`: Content reviewed and improved
- `HUMAN_REVIEW_PENDING`: Awaiting human review
- `HUMAN_APPROVED`: Human-approved content
- `FINALIZED`: Ready for publication
- `PUBLISHED`: Published content

## Agent Types

- `SCRAPER`: Web scraping agent
- `AI_WRITER`: Content enhancement AI
- `AI_REVIEWER`: Content review AI
- `HUMAN_WRITER`: Human content creator
- `HUMAN_REVIEWER`: Human content reviewer
- `HUMAN_EDITOR`: Human content editor
